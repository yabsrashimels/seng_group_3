GIT BASICS – INTERACTIVE NOTES


1. What does git add do?
--------------------------------------------------
The `git add` command stages changes from your working directory
for the next commit. It moves selected file changes into the
staging area (index).

Key points:
- Starts tracking new files
- Stages changes in modified files
- Does NOT create a commit

Common usage:
git add <file>        → Stage a specific file
git add .             → Stage all changes in current directory
git add -A            → Stage all changes including deletions
git add -p            → Interactively stage parts of files

Use `git status` to check staged vs unstaged files.


2. What is the use of -u (set upstream)?
--------------------------------------------------
The `-u` or `--set-upstream` option is commonly used with `git push`.

Command:
git push -u origin <branch-name>

What it does:
- Pushes your local branch to the remote repository
- Links the local branch with the remote branch

Benefits:
- Allows using `git push` and `git pull` without arguments
- Shows ahead/behind info in `git status`
- View tracking branches using:
  git branch -vv

Example:
git push -u origin feature-x

Manual upstream setup:
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch-name>


3. What is a commit?
--------------------------------------------------
A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.

Each commit includes:
- A unique hash ID
- A commit message
- Author and timestamp

Workflow:
1. Edit files
2. Stage changes: git add
3. Save snapshot: git commit -m "message"
4. Share changes: git push

Good commits are small, focused, and clearly described.


4. What is git pull?
--------------------------------------------------
`git pull` updates your local branch with changes from a remote
repository.

It does two things:
1. git fetch  → Downloads new commits
2. git merge  → Merges them into current branch

Commands:
git pull
git pull origin main
git pull --rebase

Difference from git fetch:
- fetch downloads changes only
- pull fetches + merges automatically

Always commit or stash local changes before pulling.


5. What is a branch?
--------------------------------------------------
A branch is a parallel version of the repository.

Key concepts:
- Default branch is usually `main`
- Branches allow isolated development
- Used for features, bug fixes, experiments

Example workflow:
- Create branch: feature/login-page
- Commit changes
- Open pull request
- Merge into main
- Delete feature branch

Branches enable safe collaboration and clean history.


6. What is a merge conflict?
--------------------------------------------------
A merge conflict happens when Git cannot automatically combine
changes from two branches.

Causes:
- Same file edited in same lines
- Conflicting changes between branches

Conflict markers:
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>>>>>>>

Steps to resolve:
1. Open the conflicted file
2. Choose correct changes
3. Remove conflict markers
4. Stage file: git add <file>
5. Commit: git commit

Avoid conflicts by pulling often and keeping branches small.


7. Command to clone a remote repository
--------------------------------------------------
Basic command:
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

Options:
Clone into custom folder:
git clone <url> my-folder

Clone specific branch:
git clone -b branch-name <url>

Shallow clone:
git clone --depth 1 <url>


8. Command to connect local repo to remote repo
--------------------------------------------------
Add remote repository:
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

Verify remote:
git remote -v

Push and set upstream:
git push -u origin main


9. First-time push to remote repository
--------------------------------------------------
Command:
git push -u origin main

Explanation:
- Pushes commits to remote
- Sets upstream tracking
- Simplifies future push/pull

After this:
git push


10. Command to pull latest changes from remote
--------------------------------------------------
Basic command:
git pull

Explicit command:
git pull origin main

Rebase instead of merge:
git pull --rebase

Fetch only:
git fetch
git merge origin/main

If conflicts occur:
- Resolve files
- git add <file>
- git commit
